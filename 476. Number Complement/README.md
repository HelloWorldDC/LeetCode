# 476. Number Complement

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

<li>For example, The integer <code>5</code> is <code>"101"</code> in binary and its <strong>complement</strong> is <code>"010"</code> which is the integer <code>2</code>.</li>

<br/>
 
Given an integer `num`, return *its complement*.

 


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** num = 5  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** num = 1  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

**Constraints:**

<li><code>1 &lt;= num &lt; 2<sup>31</sup></code></li>
