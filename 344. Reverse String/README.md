# 344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm "in-place") with `O(1)` extra memory.

 

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]  
**Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]  

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]  
**Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

**Constraints:**

<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
<li><code>s[i]</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters" target="_blank">printable ascii character</a>.</li>
