# 389. Find the Difference

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "abcd", t = "abcde"  
**Output:** "e"  
**Explanation:** 'e' is the letter that was added.

**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "", t = "y"  
**Output:** "y"
 

**Constraints:**

<li><code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
<li><code>t.length == s.length + 1</code></li>
<li><code>s</code> and <code>t</code> consist of lowercase English letters.</li>
